*Project name:* Summer Activity Manager

## Description
Summer Activity Manager is a Python-based project that helps me plan and manage my summer activities. The core functionalities include generating random activities, tracking walking progress towards a goal, a daily task game that awards points based on task completion, and displaying quotes.

This project was done to show some of the things gained from "Fundamentals of Computer Science and Programming" (DIP750), such as string manipulation, calculations, output formatting, conditionals and loops, functions, lists, libraries, dictionaries, and using APIs.

### Features:
*What to do?*: Provides activity suggestions from a predefined dictionary based on the day (weekday or weekend) and the participants (one or multiple).

*Walking challenge*: Helps to track progress towards a walking goal. It calculates the remaining kilometers and gives motivational feedback based on input.

*Daily task game*: A game that asks if 6 daily tasks are completed and awards points based on the responses.

*Quote of the Day*: Fetches a random quote from an online API (ZenQuotes API) and displays it using a randomly selected font.

## Instructions

This project uses the requests and pyfiglet libraries. You can install them using pip: 

```
pip install requests pyfiglet
```

Run the program and follow the on-screen instructions to interact with the program. You can choose from generating random activities, getting a quote of the day, participating in the KM walking challenge, or playing the daily task game.
